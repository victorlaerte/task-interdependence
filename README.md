It's know that github doesn't support doc and docx versioning. An alternative would be to use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) but as we are using an ACM templale, the google docs tend to unformat the document. So this repository is configured with a webhook that after you push your modifications to any .doc file a markdown file .md is generated automaticaly, so this way we can easyly follow all modifications made by the author.
